# Bambu Studio setup script

Quickly setup Bambu Studio as a proper application in Ubuntu, with a one liner
to upgrade to the latest version from
https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases.

Run:

```
./upgrade_bambu.sh
./upgrade_orca.sh
```

Then press the WinKey, type Bambu, right click and "Add to Favorites"

May have to accept the ssl certificate, and install en_GB.UTF-8 locale.
